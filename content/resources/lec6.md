  notes were taken in the Fall of 2001 by Jeremy Schnittman, who as a student in the

  Paul Schechter's handwritten notes in producing them. The figures were produced
  by Caitlin Millard during June-August 2004. Used with permission. As of the date
  of publication, only lecture notes for sessions 1 through 11 were available.
